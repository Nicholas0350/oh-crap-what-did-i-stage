# ðŸŽ­ The "Oh Crap, What Did I Stage?" Script

For brilliant minds spawning a million ideas but forgetting which ones they actually worked on.

## ðŸ§  Why You Need This

- Brain: constant fireworks show of ideas
- Half-finished projects outnumber socks
- Mystery code regularly appears in repos

## ðŸ›  Setup (Even You Can Do This!)

1. Save as `check_staged.sh` (or `what_the_heck_did_i_do.sh` if you're feeling saucy)
2. Make executable:
   ```
   chmod +x check_staged.sh
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file (because we all love more config files, right?)
4. Run:
   ```
   ./check_staged.sh
   ```

## ðŸŽ¬ The Magic Show

1. Hunts Git repos like caffeinated bloodhound
2. Sniffs out forgotten staged changes
3. Time-travels to last touch
4. Presents chaos in neat, sorted list
