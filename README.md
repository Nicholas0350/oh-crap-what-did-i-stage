# ðŸŽ­ The "Oh Crap, What Did I Stage?" Script

For brilliant minds spawning a million ideas but forgetting which ones they actually worked on.

## ðŸ§  Why You Need This

- Brain: constant fireworks show of ideas
- Half-finished projects outnumber socks
- Mystery code regularly appears in repos

## ðŸ›  Setup (Even You Can Do This!)

1. Save as `check_staged.sh` (or `what_the_heck_did_i_do.sh` if you're feeling saucy)
2. Make executable:
   ```
   chmod +x check_staged.sh
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file (because we all love more config files, right?)
4. Run:
   ```
   ./check_staged.sh
   ```

## ðŸŽ¬ The Magic Show

1. Hunts Git repos like a caffeinated bloodhound (because who doesn't love a good repo chase?)
2. Sniffs out recent commits with the precision of a truffle pig (30 days, because who remembers what they did yesterday?)
3. Time-travels through your commit history (no DeLorean required, just good old Git)
4. Presents your coding chaos in a neat, sorted list (because nothing says "productive" like a list of all the repos you've neglected)
5. Makes you question your life choices as you realize how many projects you've started (and abandoned)
6. Gives you a perfect excuse for why you haven't finished that one project ("But look at all these other repos I've been working on!")
